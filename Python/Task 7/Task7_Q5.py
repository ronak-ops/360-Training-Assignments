# Write a Person class with an instance variable “age” and a constructor that takes an integer as a parameter. The constructor must assign the integer value to the age variable after confirming the argument passed is not negative; if a negative argument is passed then the constructor should set age to 0 and print “Age is not valid, setting age to 0”. In addition, you must write the following instance methods:
# - yearPasses() should increase age by the integer value that you are passing inside the function. 
# - amIOld() should perform the following conditional actions:I 
# •	f age is between 0 and <13, print “You are young”. 
# •	If age is >=13 and <=19 , print “You are a teenager”. 
# •	Otherwise, print “You are old”. 

# Sample Input for amIOld(): 
# -1 
# 4
# 10 
# 16 
# 18 
# 64 
# 38
# Expected Output for amIOld(): 
# Age is not valid, setting age to 0. 
# You are young. 
# You are young. 
# You are a teenager. 
# You are a teenager. 
# You are old. 
# You are old. 
# Consider the age variable to be set to 38 then: 
# Sample Input for yearPasses(): 4 
# Expected Output for yearPasses(): 42
