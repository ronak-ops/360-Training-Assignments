# Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and generates a list and a tuple which contains every number in the form of string. 
# Sample input: 34,67,55,33,12,98 
# Expected output: [‘34’,’67’,’55’,’33’,’12’,’98’] (‘34’,’67’,’55’,’33’,’12’,’98’)

data = input('Enter sequence of comma-separated numbers: ')

print(data.split(','))
print(tuple(data.split(',')))
