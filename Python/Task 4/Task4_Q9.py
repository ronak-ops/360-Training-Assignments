# Write a function called showNumbers that takes a parameter called limit. It should print all the numbers between 0 and limit with a label to identify the even and odd numbers. 
# Sample input: show Numbers(3) (where limit=3) 
# Expected output: 
# 0 EVEN 
# 1 ODD 
# 2 EVEN 
# 3 ODD

        else:
            print(i, end=" ")
